# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Build your project locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)** and sign up/login

3. **Deploy your site:**
   - Click **"Add new site"**
   - Choose **"Import an existing project"**
   - Connect your **GitHub** repository (or drag & drop the `dist` folder)
   - Set build settings:
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - Click **"Deploy site"**

### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## 📋 Configuration Files Created

### `netlify.toml`
- Sets build command and publish directory
- Configures SPA routing redirects
- Adds security headers
- Sets Node.js version

### `public/_redirects`
- Handles client-side routing for React Router
- Redirects all routes to `index.html`

## 🔧 Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app uses environment variables:

1. Go to **Site settings** > **Environment variables**
2. Add your variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`)

## 🌐 Backend Integration

Since this is a frontend-only deployment, you'll need to:

1. **Deploy your backend separately** (Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean, etc.)
2. **Update API calls** in your React app to point to your backend URL
3. **Update CORS settings** in your backend to allow your Netlify domain

Example API configuration:
```javascript
// In your React components
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? 'https://your-backend-url.com'
  : 'http://localhost:5000';
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors on Refresh
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in the `public` folder
- Check that `netlify.toml` has the correct redirect rules

### Build Failures
- Verify Node.js version (set to 18 in `netlify.toml`)
- Check for missing dependencies
- Ensure all environment variables are set

### API Connection Issues
- Update your backend CORS settings
- Check that API URLs are correct for production
- Verify backend is deployed and accessible

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Already Configured:
- ✅ Code splitting (configured in webpack)
- ✅ Asset optimization
- ✅ Cache headers for static assets
- ✅ Compression

### Additional Optimizations:
- Enable **HTTP/2** (automatic on Netlify)

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection` - Enables XSS filtering
- `X-Content-Type-Options` - Prevents MIME sniffing
